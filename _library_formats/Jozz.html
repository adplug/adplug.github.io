<p>JCH sent me this wonderful archive of adlib music made by Johannes
Bjerregaard (Maniacs of Noise at that time) around 1992. The music was
written in his own driver routine. A (somewhat buggy) player is
included in the archive. Nothing more is known about the internals of
the format. I wish someone would figure it out since the music is
really wonderful!</p>
