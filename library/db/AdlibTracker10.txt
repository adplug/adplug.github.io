Adlib Tracker 1.0
<p>Recently I ran across another delightful format which makes use of
the .SNG extension. The tracker is called simply, "Adlib Tracker". Its
distribution package came with little documentation or related
files. Upon contacting its creator (Tjeerd Sietsma), I received the
specifications for the format.</p>

<p>Attached, please find "Adlib Tracker", sample song, sample
instrument bank, docs, specifications.</p>
