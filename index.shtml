<h1>Description:</h1>
<p>AdPlug is a free, cross-platform, hardware independent AdLib sound player library, mainly written in C++ and
released under the LGPL. AdPlug plays sound data, originally created for the AdLib (OPL2) audio board, directly
from its original format on top of an OPL2 emulator or by using the real hardware. No OPL chip is required for
playback.</p>

<p>AdPlug itself is just the backend to many different audio player frontends, which are also being developed
here. There are plugins for popular audio players, like Winamp and XMMS, as well as stand-alone players for
many different systems available.</p>
