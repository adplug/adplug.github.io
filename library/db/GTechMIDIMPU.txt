G-Tech MIDI MPU Format
General MIDI like format. I've only got 1 test file as its still in
the Beta Stages, and half the commands are never to be impletmented,
i'll include another File Document on my final format. I'm trying to
make my GMD player for Adlib cards aswell, but it uses the MPU-401 to
play in DOS. The archive contains the QBasic source code of the
current player, since its still in Beta, the final will be assembly.
