<h1>License</h1>
<p>The AdPlug core library and all frontends are licensed under the
LGPL or another OSI compliant license. The binaries and source code from
release 1.6 to 1.8.2 inclusive incorporate new OPL2 and OPL3 emulators,
which bear a part of the MAME license and thus dual licenses the library.
The additional license restricts commercial redistribution for those emulators
and is presented below:</p>

<pre>
Tatsuyuki Satoh and Jarek Burczynski's YM3812 emulator, constituted in
this distribution by the files `src/fmopl.c' and `src/fmopl.h', and
only these files, as well as Jarek Burczynski's YMF262 emulator,
constituted in this distribution by the files 'src/ymf262.cpp' and
'src/ymf262.h', and only these files, is covered by paragraph VI of
the MAME license:

VI. Reuse of Source Code
--------------------------
   This chapter might not apply to specific portions of MAME (e.g. CPU
   emulators) which bear different copyright notices.
   The source code cannot be used in a commercial product without the written
   authorization of the authors. Use in non-commercial products is allowed, and
   indeed encouraged.  If you use portions of the MAME source code in your
   program, however, you must make the full source code freely available as
   well.
   Usage of the _information_ contained in the source code is free for any use.
   However, given the amount of time and energy it took to collect this
   information, if you find new information we would appreciate if you made it
   freely available as well.
