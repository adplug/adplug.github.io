<p>The IMS Format is an Ad Lib music format, based on the standard MIDI
format. It is commonly seen in Korean DOS games.</p>

<p>The format is very similar to the AdLib MIDI Format, but has an additional
instrument table appended. The instruments themselves are stored in a
separate instrument bank in AdLib Instrument Bank Format.</p>

<p>Format documentation is available
