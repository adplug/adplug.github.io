<p>eXtra Simple Music Player by Davey W. Taylor can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/qb40/abc-archive">All BASIC Code archive</a> package called FMLIB (SOUND.ABC, 1997).</p>

<p>It is a simple (as the name implies ;) package to play FM music using QBasic. There is no tracker included to produce XSM files, hence it is unlikely that more XSM files other than the four included demo songs exist.</p>

<p>Davey W. Taylor later went on to write an FM Tracker in QBasic which uses an incompatible file format.</p>
