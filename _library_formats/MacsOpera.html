<p>I've attached two games that use CMF files (Stone Age and Dimo's Quest). I
unpacked fxdriver.exe and viewed it, and it appears that it also reads CIF
files (of which I don't have any). The credits for Stone Age say the music
was created with something called "MacsOpera".</p>

<p>I've also attached a file that documents as much as I can determine about
the CMF format. A program called File Monitor helped me here (see its output
in FM_log.zip). With your experience you could probably work out the gaps -
I imagine they're similar to other Adlib tracker formats.</p>

<p>You're under no obligation to make a player for it. I just think it would be
cool to bring back a tracker format from the dead.</p>

<p>I don't know how much use the fxdriver.exe file would be to you in figuring
out the problem. An idea I had is to record a tune into RAW format and
analyse that. I've attached Stone Age RAW files if you need them (although I
may have clipped off some important stuff from the beginning of them during
editing).</p>
