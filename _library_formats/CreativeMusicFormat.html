<p>
This is a file format made by Creative Labs based on MIDI, but with a different header and includes OPL instruments in SBI format (stored without SBI header).
Creative Labs never released an official editor, so to make CMF files the process is to convert file from other file formats like MIDI and SBI into CMF.
