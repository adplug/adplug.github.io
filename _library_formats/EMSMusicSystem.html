<p>I have here the sources + docs for Sean Connolly's .EMS adlib music
format. The songs are stored in ASM (seperately) as are the player
routines. What I would suggest is that you compile the musics to .EMS
format and then work the player into AdPlug.</p>

<p>I know it may be a bit of work, but I would certainly appreciate it
if you took this format into strong consideration
regardless. Mr. Connolly based the tunes (as you will see) on C=64
tunes, and he still upholds support for this format, meaning more
musics should be available before too long.</p>

<p>If it will be too much work to implement, no problem. I just
thought it would be real neat to see AdPlug support the .EMS music
once it was compiled (as the original music was distributed compiled
w/player built-in).</p>
