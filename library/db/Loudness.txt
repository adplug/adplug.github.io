Loudness
<p>Phil Hassey once hacked together a preliminary Loudness player,
which he sent to me. In this package, there's also a file readres.c,
which extracts the music modules from the Tyrian game's resource files
and a file fixem.c, which is supposed to fix some broken Loudness
files. I would be very happy if this file format would finally be
supported by AdPlug, some day!</p>

<p>If anyone knows anything about this format, its authors,
people/companies who used it, or anything else, PLEASE contact me at
dn.tlp@gmx.net!</p>
