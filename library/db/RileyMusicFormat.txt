Riley Music Format
<p>Some time ago I discovered RMF, which was created to be a
replacement or upgrade of sorts for CMF. However, the project was
abandoned before a player was publicly released. I contacted the
creator of the new format, but he did not respond. It has been so long
now, I doubt he ever will. Unfortunate.</p>

<p>However - from his website, I was able to take both the
specifications and description of how the RMF format is build and how
it works, and also a program to convert CMF format over to RMF.</p>

<p>Thus, please find attached these resources, plus two sample RMF
tunes that I converted. If you are able to make headway with this,
perhaps RMF can finally be supported so people can find out about
it. If not - *shrugs* - was worth a try.</p>
