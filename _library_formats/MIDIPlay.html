<p>The MDI format was created by Ad Lib, Inc. and is derived from ROL Format
- it have compatible specification for playback. It uses a standard MIDI file
structure (MIDI Type 0) that contains MIDI meta events for setting OPL
instrument settings. It is a way of storing FM/OPL instruments inside a
standard MIDI file, with the file being a standard, fully compatible .mid
file. Players that are not aware of the FM/OPL commands will simply ignore
them and play the file without instruments.</p>
