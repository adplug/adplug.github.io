Troddlers Music Format
<p>This is the adlib patch engine of Mr. Johannes Bjerregaard,
originally created for the IBM-PC version of the game "Troddlers", but
never publicly released. The tools are used to create patches for
standard MIDI music, and various players are included (SMFPTEST, etc.)
to replay the files. The MID and MFP both must be in the same
directory.</p>

<p>The purpose of this package was to put a great-sounding adlib sound
to MIDI music by creating adlib patch data to go with it. You will
notice the "DD3TIT0.MID" - title music from the IBM-PC version of
"Double Dragon 3". Mr. Bjerregaard says that his SNG and JBM formats
branched from this package, but I think it may be true that Jesper
Olsen also made use of it to create his .PJO format!</p>

<p>I am very excited about this particular set. I was hoping that with
the included sources, you would be able to work a system into
AdPlug/AdPlay where the adlib patches for the MIDI tunes can be heard
by selecting the MFP file and having the player pick up the MID and
handle them that way ... requiring two files (MID and MFP) to play a
song would be an unusual occurance, but I think this format is unique
to have it.</p>
