Using the Forte Media Fm801 FM Synth with AdPlug on Windows XP</a>
<a href="files/fm801.tar.gz">(download archive)</a></td>
<td>Darron Broad wrote a nice tutorial on how to get AdPlug to produce
sound on soundcards with a Forte Media Fm801 FM chip on Windows XP,
along with a really neat mixer application that is needed in order to
achieve this.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="files/sb16switch.zip">SB FM Switch</a></td>
<td>A workaround for Sound Blaster users, who can't get the real OPL2
output with the AdPlug Winamp input plugin to work. This is a known
problem with the Creative FM driver. This workaround is provided by
Zbigniew Luszpinski.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="files/examples.zip">Example Tunes</a></td>
<td>Some packaged example tunes by various composers to demonstrate
AdPlug's capabilities. The copyright of the included modules relies to
