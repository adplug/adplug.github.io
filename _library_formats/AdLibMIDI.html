<p>The MDI format was created by Ad Lib, Inc. to upgrade from ROL
format. It uses the MIDI structure but incorporates OPL2 commands that
allow it to store instrument data and change modes, similar to how CMF
works.</p>

<p>Some documentation about the format is available
<a href="http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php?title=MDI">here</a>.</p>
