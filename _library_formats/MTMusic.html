<p>I have just been sent a copy of MTMusic, written by Markku Tuariala
(taurus x). I originally thought the author and I were speaking of the
.MTM module format - but this is not that format. This is a different
one. Included in this archive are the MTMusic drivers, a player,
sample music, and, of course, full source code.</p>

<p>The extension for MTMusic songs is .MTM, and they are quite
interesting. Check 'em out.</p>
